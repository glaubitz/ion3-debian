ion3 (20070506-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ion3 is now in the non-free section due to a trademark claim and
    conditions on the use of its name.
  
  * The change in behaviour of the frame context menu in 20070318 has
    been reverted.

  * Other significant changes are listed in RELNOTES.gz.

  * The context menu for a frame now affects the current window, not
    the window whose tab the pointer was over when it opened.  For
    example, you cannot close a window that is not being displayed by
    opening a context menu over its tab.  That will close the current
    window instead.

  * There is a new configuration file cfg_defaults.lua which loads the
    default set of modules and other configuration files.  This means
    cfg_ion.lua can easily and safely be customised so long as it
    calls do_path("cfg_defaults").  cfg_user.lua is now considered
    obsolete, though it is still loaded if present.

  * Various backward compatibility code has been removed.  This may
    require changes to custom scripts.

  * Other significant changes are listed in RELNOTES.gz.

ion3 (20070203-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * There's been changes in padding/spacing usage in styles. Frames
    now surround stuff inside borders not with `spacing` pixels, but
    with `padding_pixels`. Spacing is only used to space things within
    the borders (all the tabs and the client window from each other).
    Consequently, custom styles may need to be updated to reflect this,
    by increasing the padding, possibly also altering/removing colour
    (to set it to background colour).

  * The use of drawing engine attributes has also changed, and strict
    ordering of them in the styles is no longer necessary. Additionally,
    much more attributes are supported, including the name of every
    statusbar meter.

  * Xinerama support is gone. In addition to being problematic as such,
    it had bit-rotted, and I will not waste time fixing it.

  * `ioncore.set` no longer supports the `default_ws_params^N parameter
    for configuring the default layout. It is replaced by
    `ioncore.deflayout("default", { ... })`, which allows configuring
    other layouts as well, known by `mod_query.query_workspace` (F9).
    Some default layouts are configured in `cfg_layout.lua`.

  * It is now possible to automatically create new workspaces for
    windows with the `new_group` winprop.

  Mostly this release still fixes issues in the big 3ds-20061015 release,
  but in addition there are some improvements in the query department:
 
  * Query activation key now cycles completions (So e.g. the
    in the context menu activated with META+M, this same key
    can be used to cycle through the alternatives.) This does
    not work for queries activated by submap bindings.
 
  * Likewise, it is no longer necessary to specify the key to
    use for cycling for `mod_menu.grabmenu`.
 
  * Control+R can now be used for history completion in queries.
    (Currently matching is done for full string up to 'point', but
    this may be changed to substring match.)
 
  * Note that the parametrisation of WEdln.complete has changed,
    and the second cycle parameter must be 'next' now instead of
    `true`.

  * WIonWS and WFloatWS and the corresponding modules are also gone, and
    your custom configuration files will be broken with regard to these.
    However, a partial backwards compatibility hack exists for layout
    savefiles.

    The F9 and META-F9 bindings now by default create workspaces with
    a tiled layout of two frames. To create an "empty" workspace,
    corresponding to the old WFloatWS, use the context menu (META-M)
    and chose "new-empty-workspace". It is also possible to change
    the default layout.

  * Note that if you restart from an old version to this new version of Ion,
    transients will stop working as expected for already existing windows.
    They will work for newly-created windows, however.

  * There are a few new sets of binding (including one for ^WClientWin!),
    and some old bindings may not work exactly as expected anymore. In
    particular, those for switching to full-screen mode.

    **
    It is probably best to start from scratch with your custom bindings.
    **

  * ^WFrame.set_tabbar is gone. If you absolutely want to get rid off
    the tabs, you must change the frame's "mode" with ^WFrame.set_mode.
    The mode "tiled-alt" has been intended for this, and the corresponding
    "framed-tiled-alt" style defaults to ^Bar = "none".

  * The rather popular ^Detach.lua script from the scripts repository
    is obsoleted now, as Ion includes detach functionality in itself.
    To detach a window, use META-K D in the default bindings. To tile
    an existing from an a workspace that doesn't have a tiling yet,
    use META-K B.

  * Changes in the set of configuration files.
  
    - cfg_ion.lua now simply load cfg_ioncore.lua and cfg_modules.lua
      with the default set of modules, and includes some of the most
      commonly changed options commented-out. This deprecates cfg_user.lua
    - cfg_menus.lua and cfg_bindings.lua are now cfg_ioncore.lua. This
      better matches how things for different modules are in their own
      files.

  * The scrachpad class was removed. The scratchpad is just a normal frame
    now, with a few special attributes. Your scratchpad configuration from
    the layout savefile will be lost (and complained of). A new one should
    open with the toggle key.
                                                                                                                                                               
  * There's generic size policy code that both mplexes and client windows                                                                                      
    use (for transients). The default size policy for (framed) transients

  * Those with custom configuration files should note that many exported toggle
    functions were changed and renamed, and now accept a string parameter
    incidating whether to toggle, set or unset the property.

     - WClientwin.set_fullsreen (replaces WClientWin.toggle_fullscreen)
     - WRegion.set_tagged (replaces WRegion.tag/untag/toggle_tag)
     - WFrame.set_tabbar (replaces WFrame.toggle_tabbar)
     - WFrame.set_shaded (replaces WFrame.toggle_shade)
     - WFloatFrame.set_sticky (replaces WFloatFrame.toggle_sticky)
     - WMPlex.l2_set_hidden (replaces WMPlex.l2_hide/show)
     - mod_sp.set_shown(_on) (replaces mod_sp.toggle(_on))
     - mod_dock.set_floating_shown_on (replaces mod_dock.toggle_floating_on)
     - WRegion.set_activity (replaces WRegion.clear_activity and
       WRegion.notify_activity)
   
    For example, WRegion.set_tagged(_, 'toggle') should be used in place of
    WRegion.toggle_tagged(_) now.
