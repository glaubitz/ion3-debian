    the source from debian/rules.
  * Removed examples, because they're for Ion2.
  * Renamed debian-menus.lua to debian-menu.lua.

  * Lowered ion2-doc's priority to extra.

  * Create the include/ion symlink when building if it doesn't exist,
    since Subversion doesn't allow symlinks.

ion2 (0.0.20040207-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Versioned the Lua dependencies to >> 5.0.2.

    in /usr/lib.

ion2 (0.0.20040207-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check if the menu package is installed before including
    /usr/share/ion2/debian-menus.lua, to avoid errors if this is not the
    case. Closes: #234343.
  * Raised x-window-manager alternative priority to 50 per policy
    11.8.4.
  * Also add pwm2 as an alternative to x-window-manager. But set priority
    to 49 because it's less important than ion2.
  * Removed leading "A" from ion2 synopsis.
  * Updated description.
  * Added website URL to description.
  * Updated doc-base description as well.
  * Generate PDF version of the documentation instead of PostScript. This
    is what the developer's reference tells me to do and, well, why
    not. You get nice hyperlinks.

 -- Per Olofsson <pelle@dsv.su.se>  Tue,  2 Mar 2004 00:19:34 +0100

ion2 (0.0.20040207-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed the prebuilt documentation included in the new ion-doc
    version.
  * Removed the ionnotes manual because upstream doesn't think it's mature
    enough.
  * Use the target realclean when cleaning the documentation source
    directory.
  * Rewrote ion2-doc description.
  * Small change in ion2 description.
  * Modified debian/ion2.menu-method to use complete section names as
    identifiers for submenus instead of just titles. This makes it
    possible to have more than one submenu with the same title.
  * Don't use absolute path when including debian-menus.lua from
    ion-menus.lua.
  * Place debian-menus.lua in /usr/share/ion2 instead of
    /etc/X11/ion2. This makes sure the user doesn't accidentally copy it
    to ~/.ion2/.
  * Don't refer to /usr/share/doc/menu/README in the generated menu file
    because it doesn't exist.
  * Remove /usr/share/ion2/debian-menus.lua in debian/ion2.prerm when
    removing the package.

ion2 (0.0.20040131-1) unstable; urgency=low

    former does not seem to exist in Debian.
  * Hevea fix in ion-doc/ionconf.tex again (forgot to change %begin to
    \begin etc.).
  * Don't give option dvipdfm to hyperref in ion-doc/macros.tex because we
    don't make pdf's in this package and it produces a lot of ugly
    warnings when converting to Postscript.

ion2 (0.0.20040127-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed priority to optional.
  * Added that extra .0 to Standards-Version :)
  * Updated descriptions.
  * Only depend on libtool (>> 1.4) and gcc (>> 3).
  * Removed ion2-dev.preinst because there's no need to remove a doc
    directory from ion-devel-dev anymore.
  * Updated share/welcome_message.head.
  * Added dependency on libtool and gcc (>> 3) to ion2-dev.
  * Added conflict with ion versions which do not use alternatives for the
    ion executable.
  * Added copyright notice from dock/dock.c to debian/copyright and made
    some small indentation changes.
  * Uncommented POSIX_SOURCE and XOPEN_SOURCE in system.mk and removed

  * Wrote a README.Debian for the ion2 package.
  * Hevea fix in ion-doc/ionconf.tex.
  * Added PWM2 to Debian menu.
  * Restart to PWM2 instead of PWM in etc/ion-menus.lua.
  * Updated PWM menus similar to the Ion menus (including adding Debian
    menu).

ion-devel (0.0.20031211-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed DEFAULT_MOD+Menu keybinding since the Menu keysym is not
    available in all XFree86 keyboard models, and it generates an error
    message on startup if it is not. This has already been done in the Ion SVN
    repository. (closes: #226034)

ion-devel (0.0.20031211-2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Per Olofsson <pelle@dsv.su.se>  Thu,  1 Jan 2004 13:37:55 +0100

ion-devel (0.0.20031211-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

      ~/.ion-devel.
  * ion-doc updated to version 20031211.
  * Remove ion-doc/.log when doing make clean.
  * Added copyright notice for the documentation to debian/copyright.
  * Provide ion-devel-api-n where n is the API version.
  * Don't rename ioncore in debian/rules because it doesn't exist anymore.
  * Removed ion-devel-core manual page because ion-devel-core doesn't
    exist anymore.
  * Rename ion.1 not ion.1x in debian/rules.
  * Rename pwm binary and manual page to pwm-devel in debian/rules.
  * Modified man/pwm.1.in similarly to the ion manpage to point out that
    it's the -devel version.
  * Modified man/ion.1.in to refer to the ion-devel-doc package for
    documentation.
  * Rebuilt man/ion.1.in.txt.
  * Modified share/welcome_message.head to fit the Debian package better.
  * Pulled ion/ion.c from CVS to fix bug which caused
    ~/.ion2/.welcome_msg_displayed to be created with weird permissions.
  * Pulled etc/look-clean.lua from CVS to get a menu font size which exist
    in the standard Debian X font packages.
  * Pulled query/querylib.lua from CVS to make the default manpage work
    (F1+Enter).
  * Restructured debian/copyright once again and added some information
    which were missing.

 -- Per Olofsson <pelle@dsv.su.se>  Fri, 26 Dec 2003 22:18:37 +0100

ion-devel (0.0.20031121-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added ion-devel-doc. (closes: #212719)
  * Modified the source for the documentation to build HTML output with
    hevea instead of latex2html, since latex2html is
    non-free. Unfortunately the output is not as good, but it is probably
    good enough.
  * Added README.Debian to ion-devel-doc which informs about the above.
  * Uncommented the XMMS kludges in etc/kludges.lua which was added by
    upstream.
  * Removed -D_GNU_SOURCE from POSIX_SOURCE variable in system.mk because
    it's now defined in the affected source file (libtu/output.c).
  * Modified query/querylib.lua to prompt "Manual page (ion-devel)"
    instead of "Manual page (ion)" when F1 is pressed.
  * Remove pre-compiled Lua files /usr/share/ion-devel/*.lc because lua
    5.0.0 is buggy. They will be included when lua 5.0.1 is in Debian.
  * Use x-terminal-emulator and sensible-browser in etc/ioncore-menus.lua.

ion-devel (0.0.20030814-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabled UTF-8 support because it causes problems for some
    people. (closes: #216511)
  * Restructured beginning of debian/copyright.

ion-devel (0.0.20030814-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Call uname without -p in etc/ioncore-bindings.lua since that option is
    not present in Debian. (closes: #212628)
  * Split the rules in debian/rules into -indep and -arch for an
    ion-devel-doc package, but removed the actual package for now because
    of GFDL non-freeness.
  * Restructured debian/copyright a little.
  * Define _GNU_SOURCE when compiling so that asprintf gets declared.
  * Took luaextl/luaextl.[ch] and ioncore/readconfig.c from the CVS
    snapshot to fix the funky type coercion issue with va_list which made
    Ion segfault on powerpc and (presumably) s390.  (closes: #212781)
  * Corrected build-deps: (closes: #214330, #214386)
    - gcc needs to be at least 3.0
    - only debhelper >=4 is needed, not 4.1
    - libtool/libltdl only needs to be >=1.4.2 apparently, not 1.4.3
  * Added debian/examples/alt_resize.lua with code for more intuitive
    resizing. (closes: #213903)
  * Added debian/examples/mover.lua with code for moving client windows to
    adjacent frames.
  * Modified the description further and added some information about the
    configuration language and the modularity.
  * Sponsored by Joey Hess.

  * New upstream release.
  * Dependency on Lua 5.0 added.

  * debian/rules: Don't make depend and don't pass unnecessary variables
    to make.
  * Include rules.mk and mkexports.lua in ion-devel-dev.
  * Don't rename version.h and config.h anymore. Should be solved
    upstream. ION_DEBIAN_PACKAGE makefile variable removed.
  * Helper scripts have been moved to share and lib upstream, so manual
    pages have been removed and name changes for the scripts skipped.
  * Moved config.h and system.mk to /usr/lib/ion-devel, the other
    development files are in /usr/share/ion-devel.
  * License change and copyright file cleanup.
  * Various changes to accommodate upstream changes.
  * A lot of changes removed due to successful upstream coordination :)
  * Use x-terminal-emulator instead of xterm, this had apparently
    disappeared in some version. (closes: #196410)
  * Remove /etc/X11/ion-devel and everything in it if purging.
  * Rewrote most of the package descriptions.
  * Removed some Galeon stuff from kludges.lua as upstream now provides
    one kludge for Galeon, and it is probably enough (better to keep close
    to upstream).
