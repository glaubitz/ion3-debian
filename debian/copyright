This is the Debian-packaged version of Ion3.  It is not part of the
Debian system itself due to the restrictions on modifications in the
Ion3 licence (see below).

The package was put together by Per Olofsson <pelle@dsv.su.se>, based
on the ion package created by Tommi Virtanen <tv@debian.org>.  It uses
source from:

  http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/

The author of Ion3 is Tuomo Valkonen <tuomov@iki.fi>.

--

Although this package is non-free, it can legally be auto-built.
If you are preparing a new version with a licence change that
does not allow auto-building, remove the XS-Autobuild field from
the control file and notify <nonfree@release.debian.net>.

The following notice applies to the Ion3 code and to the names "Ion",
"Ion3", etc.:

Copyright (c) Tuomo Valkonen 1999-2009.

Unless otherwise indicated in components taken from elsewhere, this software
is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 ("LGPL",
reproduced below), extended and modified with the following terms:

  If the name Ion(tm) or other names that can be associated with the Ion
  project are used to distribute this software, then:

    - A version that does not significantly differ from one of the
      copyright holder's releases, must be provided by default.

    - Significantly altered versions may be provided only if the user
      explicitly requests for those modifications to be applied, and 
      is prominently notified that the software is no longer considered 
      the standard version, and is not supported by the copyright holder.
      The version string displayed by the program must describe these
      modifications and the "support void" status.

  Versions for which the above conditions are not satisfied, must be
  renamed so that they can not be associated with the Ion project, their
  executables must be given names that do not conflict with the copyright
  holder's version, and neither the copyright holder nor the Ion project
  may be referred to for support.

  In the text of sections 0-2, 4-12, and 14-16 of the LGPL, "this License" 
  is to be understood to refer to the LGPL extended with these terms and,
  where applicable, possible similar terms related to the names of other
  works forming a whole. Sections 3 and 13 of the LGPL are void. Where
  contradictory, these additional terms take precedence over the LGPL.

End of terms.


Explanations

Trademarks: With the terms above primarily appealing to copyright law,
should any of the indicated trademarks be found invalid, does not excuse
you from the conditions imposed by those terms. The use of these names
in contexts other than redistribution of this software and modifications,
is outside the scope of the terms above, and governed by applicable
trademark or other laws. 

  With regard to modules and other extensions to Ion(tm), the permission
  is hereby granted to use "Ion" as part of the name, provided that it
  occurs in a form suggesting that the work is supported by neither the
  copyright holder nor the Ion project: "Foo for Ion" instead of "Ion Foo",
  etc.

Significant change: Bug fixes are insignificant as additions. Basic changes
that are needed to install or run the software on a target platform, are 
insignificant. Additionally, basic/small configuration changes to better 
integrate the software with the target platform, without obstructing the
standard behaviour, are insignificant. Everything else is significant, 
unless expressly declared otherwise by the copyright holder.

The Clarified Artistic License

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while
giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package
in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
modifications.

Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.
"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or
has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as
specified below.
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
the package.
"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
Package.
"Distribution fee" is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this Package
to another party.
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the right to use the
item, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions
they received it.
   
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
    Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
    duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
    disclaimers.
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
    derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from
    the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be
    considered the Standard Version.
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
    that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
    when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of
    the following:
       
     1. place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
        Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet
        or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major
        network archive site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by
        allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the
        Standard Version of the Package.
     2. use the modified Package only within your corporation or
        organization.
     3. rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
        with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
        a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that
        clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
     4. make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
     5. permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified
        Package permission to make your modifications Freely Available in
        some specific way.
   
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
    executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
       
     1. distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
        together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on
        where to get the Standard Version.
     2. accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
        Package with your modifications.
     3. give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
        document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
        with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
     4. make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
     5. offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your
        modifications, by mail order.
   
 5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package.
    If you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee you
    choose for that support. You may not charge a license fee for the right
    to use this Package itself. You may distribute this Package in
    aggregate with other (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree)
    programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree)
    software distribution, and charge license fees for other parts of that
    software distribution, provided that you do not advertise this Package
    as a product of your own. If the Package includes an interpreter, You
    may embed this Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by
    linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation,
    provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so
    embedded.
 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
    from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the
    copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and
    may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If
    such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the
    so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable
    image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as
    a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions
    of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an
    executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.
 7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
    supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate
    subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall
    not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input
    as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the
    language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests
    for the language.
 8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial
    distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package
    is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this
    Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial
    distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this
    Package.
 9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
    products derived from this software without specific prior written
    permission.
10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
